            Student of Masters in Interaction Design at IDC School of Design,
            IIT Bombay. It has been a roller coaster ride to shift my discipline
            from learning mechanical engineering to now getting into interaction
            design. I have used my engineering logic and designer imagination in
            executing diverse projects while doing my Masters at IDC.
